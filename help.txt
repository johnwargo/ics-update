The module takes an existing iCalendar (.ics) file, updates it and uses
the system's shell to launch it using the default application. This allows
users to send the meeting request using their default calendar client. 

Create an appointment, populate the subject, body fields plus any other
ones you want pre-populated then export it as an .ics file to your 
system's local hard drive. I recommend putting it in your Documents or 
Home folder.

    ics-update path_to_ics_file

The path_to_ics_file is a parameter that specifies a file path to a valid
.ics file. For example, if the .ics file was a file called call.ics 
located in the user's Documents folder, you could process the file using
the following command:

    ics-update /Users/user_name/Documents/call.ics
    
The file path pointing to the .ics file can be absolute or relative, the 
following work as well:

    ics-update ../test/call.ics
    
if the .ics file is in the user's home folder, you can simply pass the 
file name to the call to make-ics:

    ics-update ics_file_name.ics
